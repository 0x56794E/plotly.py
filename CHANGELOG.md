## [Unreleased]

## [1.8.2] - 2015-08-11
### Added
- CHANGELOG
- `sharing` keyword argument for `plotly.plotly.plot` and `plotly.plotly.iplot` with options `'public' | 'private' | 'secret'` to control the privacy of the charts. Depreciates `world_readable`

### Changed
- If the response from `plot` or `iplot` contains an error message, raise an exception

### Removed
- `height` and `width` are no longer accepted in `iplot`. Just stick them into your figure's layout instead, it'll be more consistent when you view it outside of the IPython notebook environment. So, instead of this:

	```
	py.iplot([{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [3, 1, 5]}], height=800)
	```

	do this:

	```
	py.iplot({
		'data': [{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [3, 1, 5]}],
		'layout': {'height': 800}
	})
	```

### Fixed
- The height of the graph in `iplot` respects the figure's height in layout
